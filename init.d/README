Your interview asked me to include the script to have apache start at boot.

The apache distribution comes with a very good start/stop script which I 
would use and I included it here.

Normally its in the /etc/init.d type directory but needs to be started 
in the /etc/rcX.d (X usually = 3 for servers) so either the install
(yum, apt-get, make install, etc...) makes the links or you can do it 
manually using chkconfig or service, or go old school and use 'ln -s'
